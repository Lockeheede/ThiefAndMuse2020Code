# ThiefAndMuse2020Code
A C# coded only "version" of The Thief &amp; The Muse to be added on as I learn the rest of the language...

There is a lot of practice on the fundamentals of C# (variables, arrays/lists, conditionals, loops, this, etc) as well as OOP (Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation and Polymorphism)
